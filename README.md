Learning to solve inverse problems using Wasserstein loss
=========================================================

This repository contains the code for the article "Learning to solve inverse problems using Wasserstein loss".

Contents
--------
The code contains the following

* Training using circle phantoms

Pre-trained networks
--------------------
The pre-trained networks are currently under finalization and will be released soon, in the meantime, training is just a few hours.

Dependencies
------------
The code is currently based on the latest version of [ODL](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl) and the utility library [adler](https://github.com/adler-j/adler). They can be most easily installed by running 

```bash
$ pip install https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/archive/master.zip
$ pip install https://github.com/adler-j/adler/archive/master.zip
```

The learning requires tensorflow, and the ray-transform needs [ASTRA](https://github.com/astra-toolbox/astra-toolbox) for computational feasibility

```bash
$ conda install -c astra-toolbox astra-toolbox
```
